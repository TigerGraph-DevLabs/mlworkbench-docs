    "This notebook demonstrates the use of edge loader in `pyTigerGraph`. The job of a data loader is to pull data from the TigerGraph database. Currently, the following data loaders are provided:\n",
    "* EdgeLoader, which returns batches of edges.\n",
    "* VertexLoader, which returns batches of vertices.\n",
    "* GraphLoader, which returns randomly sampled (probably disconnected) subgraphs in pandas `dataframe`, `PyG` or `DGL` format.\n",
    "* NeighborLoader, which returns subgraphs using neighbor sampling in `dataframe`, `PyG` or `DGL` format.\n",
    "* EdgeNeighborLoader, which returns subgraphs using neighbor sampling from edges in `dataframe`, `PyG` or `DGL` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data loader above can either get all the batches as a HTTP response (default) or stream every batch through Kafka. The former mechanism is good for testing with small graphs and it is fast, but it subjects to a data size limit of 2GB. For large graphs, the HTTP channel will likely fail due to size limit and network connectivity issues. Streaming via Kafka is offered for data robustness and scalability. Also, Kafka excels at multi-consumer use cases, and it is efficient for model search or hyperparameter tuning when there are multiiple consumers of the same data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data loaders support both homogeneous and heterogenous graphs. By default, they load from all vertex and edge types and treat the graph as a homogeneous graph. But they also allow users to specify what vertex and edge types to load from and what attributes to load from each type. This way users will get heterogeneous graph outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For the data loaders to work, a UDF (User Defined Function) has to be installed into the TigerGraph database. It only needs to be installed once per database and will work for all data loaders and all graphs. "
